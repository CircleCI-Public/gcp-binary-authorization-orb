description: >
  Get set up to use Binary Authorization on CircleCI, and complete an
  attestation signing for a particular container image, all at once. The
  `create-attestation` job will run all required setup commands, then
  create and sign an attestation allowing the container image to be
  successfully deployed. This example uses the minimum required
  parameters and thus assumes the following: there is an existing GKE
  cluster to use with Binary Authorization, and there is an existing PGP
  keypair stored in CircleCI. A container analysis note, attestor,
  Binary Authorization policy, and attestation are created on-the-fly.
  Although not shown in this example, a Docker image would likely be
  built and deployed to a staging/test environment in a previous job,
  and then deployed to a production cluster in a subsequent job.
